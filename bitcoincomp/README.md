# :wrench: :construction: Testing Oraclize's bitcoincomp Example 

This repo is to demonstrate how you would work with the Oraclize **computation** datasource.

The `bitcoincomp` example allows you to *retreive the balance of a Bitcoin address*.

## Notes

Oraclize replies to your `oraclize_query` with the *balance result* calling your `callback(...)`. 
You can search your transaction ID in one of the following links to verify it:

  * :mag_right::ledger: **Blocks.io**: 

      https://jungle.bloks.io/

  * :palm_tree::lion::palm_tree: **Jungle 2.0** (Get TX):
