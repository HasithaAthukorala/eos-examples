# Oraclize's Random Datasource Example 

This repo is to demonstrate how you would work with the Oraclize **random** datasource.

The `randomsample.cpp` example allows you to *retrieve a random number*.

## Notes

Oraclize replies to your `oraclize_newRandomDSQuery` by calling your `callback(...)` with the *random number result*.
You can search your transaction ID in one of the following links to verify it:

* :mag_right::ledger: [Blocks.io](https://jungle.bloks.io/): A block explorer for the Jungle 2.0 testnet.

* :palm_tree::lion::palm_tree: [Jungle 2.0](https://monitor.jungletestnet.io/#home): a transaction explorer is available selecting *Get TX* on the Jungle 2.0 testnet website.
