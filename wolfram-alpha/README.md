# Oraclize's Wolfram Alpha Example

This repo is to demonstrate how you would work with the Oraclize **WolframAlpha** datasource.

The `wolfram-alpha` example allows you to *retreive a random number from 1 to 6; and, if the number is
not 6, the callback launches a new query*.

## Notes

Oraclize replies to your `oraclize_query` with the *random number between 1 and 6 result* calling your `callback(...)`.
You can search your transaction ID in one of the following links to verify it:

* :mag_right::ledger: [Blocks.io](https://jungle.bloks.io/): a block explorer for the Jungle 2.0 testnet.

* :palm_tree::lion::palm_tree: [Jungle 2.0](https://monitor.jungletestnet.io/#home): a transaction explorer is available selecting *Get TX* on the Jungle 2.0 testnet website.
