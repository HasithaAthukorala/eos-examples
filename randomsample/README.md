# :wrench: :construction: Testing Oraclize's randomsample Example 

This repo is to demonstrate how you would work with the Oraclize **random** datasource.

The `randomsample` example allows you to *retreive a random number*.

## Notes

Oraclize replies to your `oraclize_newRandomDSQuery` with the *random number result* calling your `callback(...)`.
You can search your transaction ID in one of the following links to verify it:
