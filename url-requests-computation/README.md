# Oraclize's URL Requests Computation Example 

This repo is to demonstrate how you would work with the Oraclize **computation** datasource.

The `urlrequests` example allows you to *retrive the response of several URL requests*.

## Notes

Oraclize replies to your `oraclize_query` with the *respose body result* calling your `callback(...)`. 
You can search your transaction ID in one of the following links to verify it:

* :mag_right::ledger: [Blocks.io](https://jungle.bloks.io/): a block explorer for the Jungle 2.0 testnet.

* :palm_tree::lion::palm_tree: [Jungle 2.0](https://monitor.jungletestnet.io/#home): a transaction explorer is available selecting *Get TX* on the Jungle 2.0 testnet website.
